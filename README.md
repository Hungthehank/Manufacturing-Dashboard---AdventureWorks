# Manufacturing-Dashboard---AdventureWorks
Use Power BI to create a Dashboard to help directors and stakeholders have a visual, easy-to-understand picture of the company's production operations, to help them make better decisions and operations.

### Context: As planned, once production is complete, the products will be stored in various locations for ease of storage and distribution to customers. Production completion times may not be exactly as planned. During the warehouse inspection process, there is a possibility of damaged goods, which will be rejected to ensure that only quality products are stored for production and sale. Our job is to create an Operation Dashboard to help stakeholders in monitoring.
